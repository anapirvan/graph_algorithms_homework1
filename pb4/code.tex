\subsection*{a)}

Let $e = (s, t) \in E(P_{uv})$ such that in the graph $G' = G - e$, node $v$ is reachable from $u$. 
We want to show that there exists a shortest path from $u$ to $v$ in $G'$ that contains exactly one in-turn relative to $P_{uv}$.

By Bellman's principle of optimality, the subpaths $P_{us}$ and $P_{tv}$ (from $u$ to $s$, respectively from $t$ to $v$) are also shortest paths in $G$. 
After removing the arc $e$, the shortest path in $G'$ has the form:
\[
P'_{uv} = P_{us} + D_{st} + P_{tv},
\]
where $D_{st}$ is a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ in $G'$, which does not contain the arc $e$.

We will show that $D_{st}$ is an \textit{in-turn} relative to $P_{uv}$. 
Assume, by contradiction, that there exists an intermediate node $x \in V(D_{st}) \setminus \{s, t\}$ that also belongs to $P_{uv}$. 
We have two cases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Case 1:} $x \in V(P_{us})$. \\
    Then $P_{us} = P_{ux} + P_{xs}$ and $D_{st} = D_{sx} + D_{xt}$. The new path $P'_{uv}$ becomes:
    \[
    P'_{uv} = P_{ux} + P_{xs} + D_{sx} + D_{xt} + P_{tv}.
    \]
    Consider the alternative path $P''_{uv} = P_{ux} + D_{xt} + P_{tv}$. 
    Since all costs are strictly positive, $a(P_{xs}) > 0$ and $a(D_{sx}) > 0$, therefore:
    \[
    a(P'_{uv}) > a(P''_{uv}),
    \]
    contradiction, since the cost of $P'_{uv}$ must be minimal.

    \item \textbf{Case 2:} $x \in V(P_{tv})$. \\
    Then $P_{tv} = P_{tx} + P_{xv}$ and $D_{st} = D_{sx} + D_{xt}$. 
    Similarly, considering the alternative path $P''_{uv} = P_{us} + D_{sx} + P_{xv}$, we have:
    \[
    a(P'_{uv}) > a(P''_{uv}),
    \]
    again a contradiction.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, $D_{st}$ contains no other nodes in common with $P_{uv}$, so it is an \textit{in-turn} relative to $P_{uv}$.

\medskip
\noindent
\textbf{Conclusion:} True — there exists a shortest path from $u$ to $v$ in $G - e$ that contains exactly one in-turn relative to $P_{uv}$.

\subsection*{b)}
Let \( x \in V(P_{uv}) \) such that in \( G'' = G - x \), the node \( v \) is reachable from \( u \).
We want to show that there exists a shortest path from \( u \) to \( v \) in \( G'' \) which contains exactly one in-tour relative to \( P_{uv} \).

Let \( s \) be the predecessor of \( x \) on \( P_{uv} \) and \( t \) its successor.
The path \( P_{uv} \) can be written as:
\[
P_{uv} = P_{us} + (s, x) + (x, t) + P_{tv}.
\]
According to Bellman's principle of optimality, \( P_{us} \) and \( P_{tv} \) are shortest paths.
After removing \( x \), the shortest path in \( G'' \) is:
\[
P''_{uv} = P_{us} + D_{st} + P_{tv},
\]
where \( D_{st} \) is a shortest path from \( s \) to \( t \) in \( G'' \) (which does not contain the node \( x \)).

We assume, by contradiction, that \( D_{st} \) is not an in-tour, that is, there exists \( z \in V(D_{st}) \setminus \{s, t\} \) which belongs to \( P_{uv} \).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Case 1:} \( z \in V(P_{us}) \). \\
    Then \( P_{us} = P_{uz} + P_{zs} \) and \( D_{st} = D_{sz} + D_{zt} \).
    Similar to the previous reasoning, we construct the alternative path \( P'''_{uv} = P_{uz} + D_{zt} + P_{tv} \) and obtain:
    \[
    a(P''_{uv}) > a(P'''_{uv}),
    \]
    a contradiction.

    \item \textbf{Case 2:} \( z \in V(P_{tv}) \). \\
    Then \( P_{tv} = P_{tz} + P_{zv} \) and \( D_{st} = D_{sz} + D_{zt} \), while the alternative path \( P'''_{uv} = P_{us} + D_{sz} + P_{zv} \) has a smaller cost:
    \[
    a(P''_{uv}) > a(P'''_{uv}),
    \]
    again a contradiction.
\end{itemize}

It follows that \( D_{st} \) does not contain any other nodes from \( P_{uv} \) and, therefore, it is an \textit{in-tour} relative to \( P_{uv} \).

\medskip
\noindent
\textbf{Conclusion:} True — there exists a shortest path from \( u \) to \( v \) in \( G - x \) which contains exactly one in-tour relative to \( P_{uv} \).
