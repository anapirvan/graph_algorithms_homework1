Let G = (V, E) be a digraph and a : E → R∗+ a cost function on its arcs. Let Puv be a minimum
cost path from u to v in G with respect to a. An in-tour with respect to Puv is a path D which
intersects Puv only in its endpoints (of D).
(a) Let e ∈ E(Puv) such that in G − e, v is accesible from u. True or false: there exists a minimum
cost path from u to v in G − e containing just one in-tour with respect to Puv?
(b) Let x ∈ V (Puv) such that in G − x, v is accesible from u. True or false: there exists a minimum
cost path from u to v in G − x containing just one in-tour with respect to Puv?
