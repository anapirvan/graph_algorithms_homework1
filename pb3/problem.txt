Suppose that you live in a country which has no highways but just national and departmental
routes between cities. You know the network of these routes and you ride on them using an electric
car which has a battery of capacity b (in kWh). For each route (between two cities) of the network it
is known the energy consumption required to cross it. It is also known that the only way to charge
your car battery is to be in a city (each city has at least an electric station).
(a) Model the network using a certain digraph in order to solve the following two problems.
(b) Suppose that your daily commute is between cities s and t. Describe an efficient algorithm for
deciding if there is a suitable (for your car) pair of routes between s and t.
(c) Next year you want to buy a new electric car because your daily commute changed between
two new cities p and r. Find an efficient algorithm to determine the required new car battery
capacity. (The goal is twofold: find an electric car able to traverse paths whose traversals cost
is as small as possible).
